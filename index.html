      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <!-- Inline -->
      <p>
        Rachel is from China. Prior to joining <strong> Kellogg</strong>, she was in management consulting with McKinsey, Shanghai Office. During the summer of 2014, she had a great time interning at a B2B software company in the Bay Area and decided to become a bit more nerdy afterward. This is also the reason why she is creating this web page. While Rachel traveled a lot as a consultant, she took the opportunity to <em> explore all the great food </em> in whichever city/town she traveled to and she loves cooking at home, too. She is also passionate about watching all kinds of sports games, screaming and yelling with friends.
